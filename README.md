# Kurutu-css

A css library that is very minimal. Suitable for small projects and prototypes.
Works well if you know css. If you don't I'd not recommend this.

# Usage

Kurutu css is basically a collection of css files where each file is responsible for some set of stuff.

- [kututu-flex.css](src/kurutu-flex.css) - Flex containers
